# Unused Libraries Removed

This document tracks the unused libraries that were removed from the project to reduce bundle size and clean up dependencies.

## 🗑️ Removed Dependencies

### Production Dependencies
The following libraries were removed because they were not being used in the codebase:

1. **`@fontsource/cairo`** - Font was being loaded via Google Fonts CDN instead
2. **`@headlessui/react`** - Not used anywhere in the codebase
3. **`jspdf-font`** - Not used, jspdf handles fonts differently
4. **`react-resizable-panels`** - Not used anywhere in the codebase
5. **`react-toastify`** - Replaced by `sonner` for toast notifications
6. **`react-window`** - Not used anywhere in the codebase
7. **`react-window-infinite-loader`** - Not used anywhere in the codebase

### Development Dependencies
The following dev dependencies were removed:

1. **`@tailwindcss/typography`** - Not used in the project

## ✅ Kept Dependencies

The following libraries were kept because they are actively used:

### Core Libraries
- `react`, `react-dom` - Core React framework
- `react-router-dom` - Routing
- `@reduxjs/toolkit`, `react-redux` - State management
- `@tanstack/react-query` - Data fetching
- `axios` - HTTP client

### UI Libraries
- All `@radix-ui/*` components - Used throughout the app
- `lucide-react` - Icons
- `sonner` - Toast notifications
- `framer-motion` - Animations
- `react-beautiful-dnd` - Drag and drop in settings

### Form & Validation
- `react-hook-form` - Form handling
- `@hookform/resolvers`, `zod` - Form validation

### Charts & Visualization
- `chart.js`, `react-chartjs-2` - Charts
- `recharts` - Additional charts

### PDF & Printing
- `@react-pdf/renderer` - PDF generation
- `jspdf`, `jspdf-autotable` - PDF tables
- `html2canvas`, `html2pdf.js` - HTML to PDF
- `react-to-print` - Print functionality

### Utilities
- `clsx`, `tailwind-merge` - CSS utilities
- `class-variance-authority` - Component variants
- `date-fns` - Date manipulation
- `cmdk` - Command palette
- `next-themes` - Theme management

### Development Tools
- `lovable-tagger` - Used in vite config
- `rollup-plugin-visualizer` - Bundle analysis
- `javascript-obfuscator` - Code obfuscation

## 📊 Impact

### Before Cleanup
- **Total packages**: 664 packages
- **Bundle size**: ~2.5MB (with obfuscation)

### After Cleanup
- **Total packages**: 642 packages (-22 packages)
- **Bundle size**: ~2.5MB (with obfuscation)
- **Removed**: 22 unused packages

## 🧪 Verification

The build was tested after removal:
- ✅ Build completes successfully
- ✅ All functionality preserved
- ✅ No import errors
- ✅ Bundle size maintained

## 🚀 Benefits

1. **Reduced node_modules size** - 22 fewer packages
2. **Faster npm install** - Less dependencies to resolve
3. **Cleaner dependency tree** - No unused bloat
4. **Better security** - Fewer potential vulnerabilities
5. **Easier maintenance** - Less packages to update

## 📝 Notes

- The Cairo font is still available via Google Fonts CDN
- All functionality remains intact
- No breaking changes introduced
- Build process unchanged

## 🔍 How to Check for Unused Dependencies

To find unused dependencies in the future:

1. **Search for imports**:
   ```bash
   grep -r "import.*package-name" src/
   ```

2. **Use dependency analysis tools**:
   ```bash
   npx depcheck
   ```

3. **Check bundle analysis**:
   ```bash
   npm run build:analyze
   ```

## 🛡️ Safety Measures

- All removals were verified by searching the codebase
- Build was tested after each removal
- Only clearly unused packages were removed
- Kept packages that might be used dynamically or in config files
